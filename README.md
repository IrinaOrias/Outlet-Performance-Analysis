Blinkit Data Exploration: Outlet Performance Analysis
Tools used: SQL (for data exploration), Excel (for data cleaning and visualization)
________________________________________
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a retail grocery dataset to uncover key performance insights across different outlet types. The goal was to explore how factors such as item variety, outlet size, location, and item characteristics influence sales performance.
The project was executed using SQL for querying and Excel for data cleaning and visualization.
________________________________________
Tools Used
•	Excel: Data cleaning, basic transformations, pivot tables, and visualization
•	SQL: Querying and aggregating metrics for performance comparison
________________________________________
Data Cleaning in Excel
I began with data cleaning tasks in Excel to prepare the dataset for analysis. These steps included:
•	Removing duplicates and handling missing values
•	Ensuring consistency in data types and labels
This step ensured the dataset was accurate and ready for exploration in SQL.

SQL Analysis
After cleaning the data, I used SQL to analyze and summarize performance metrics.
KPIs and Granular Metrics
To assess the performance of retail outlets and uncover hidden patterns in the dataset, I defined and calculated a set of KPIs and granular metrics. These indicators provided both strategic insights and operational details necessary for a comprehensive analysis.
________________________________________
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
These are the main indicators I used to evaluate overall performance across the dataset:
1.	Total Sales 
2.	Average Sales
3.	Number of Items
4.	Average Rating________________________________________
Granular Metrics
These additional breakdowns provide detailed insights at a more specific level of analysis:
1.	Total Sales by Fat Content
2.	Total Sales by Item Type
3.	Fat Content by Outlet Location for Total Sales
4.	Total Sales by Outlet Establishment Year
5.	Percentage of Sales by Outlet Size
6.	Sales by Outlet Location
7.	All Metrics by Outlet Type

Excel Visualizations
After the SQL analysis, I used Excel to create visualizations for:
•	Sales performance by outlet type
•	Sales distribution across outlet size and location
•	Total revenue by item fat content
•	Year-wise outlet performance
Pivot tables and clean charts helped summarize the SQL findings visually.

Key Insights
Insights and Strategic Conclusions — Blinkit Data Exploration
________________________________________
1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
•	Total Sales: 1.2 million
•	Average Sale: $140.99
•	Number of Items: 1,559
•	Average Rating: 3.97
Insight: The high average sale value suggests that customers either buy in bulk or focus on higher-value items. A wide product range is offered, and an average rating close to 4 indicates good customer satisfaction.

2. Sales by Fat Content
•	Low Fat products significantly outperform Regular ones.
Insight: Consumers prefer low-fat options. Blinkit could expand its low-fat product line and promote these items further to meet demand.

3. Sales by Year of Outlet Establishment
•	Highest sales come from outlets opened in 1998, 2010, and 2012.
•	More recently established outlets show lower performance.
Insight: Older outlets tend to perform better, likely due to brand familiarity, customer loyalty, and established locations. This trend supports the idea that outlet maturity impacts performance.

4. Sales by Outlet Location
•	Tier 3 locations lead in total sales, followed by Tier 2 and Tier 1.
Insight: Surprisingly, lower-tier markets are the strongest performers. This may reflect reduced competition or a higher dependency on delivery services in less urbanized areas.
________________________________________
5. Percentage of Sales by Outlet Size
•	Medium outlets account for 42% of sales
•	Small outlets: 37%
•	High outlets: 21%
Insight: Medium-sized outlets are the most efficient in terms of sales generation. Larger outlets underperform relative to their size, suggesting that investments may be better allocated toward medium formats.

6. Sales by Item Type
Top-performing categories include:
•	Fruits and Vegetables
•	Snack Foods
•	Household Items
•	Frozen Foods
The lowest performing categories include:
•	Seafood
•	Hard Drinks
•	Breakfast Items
Insight: Essential and frequently replenished items dominate sales. These categories should be prioritized for optimized logistics, stocking, and targeted promotions.
________________________________________
7. Sales by Outlet Type and Fat Content
•	Supermarket Type 1 has the highest sales across both Low Fat and Regular items.
•	Other outlet types, like Grocery Stores, contribute significantly less.
Insight: Supermarket Type 1 is the most successful outlet format and a strong candidate for expansion. Its strong performance in Low Fat sales also reinforces the trend toward healthier consumer choices.
________________________________________
Strategic Recommendations
1.	Replicate the Supermarket Type 1 format in high-performing locations like Tier 3 regions.
2.	Prioritize and expand Medium-sized outlets, which show optimal balance between size and sales.
3.	Increase visibility and availability of Low Fat products across all outlets.
4.	Evaluate the performance of newer and larger outlets, and adjust strategies based on their specific challenges.
5.	Focus marketing efforts on high-demand categories such as fruits, snacks, household items, and frozen foods.
