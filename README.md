## Objective

The objective of this project was to evaluate the performance of various retail outlets based on business dimensions such as item type, outlet size, location, year of establishment, and customer preferences.

The analysis was conducted using SQL for data aggregation and Excel for data cleaning and visualization.  
The findings support data-driven decisions in outlet expansion, product planning, and targeted marketing.

## Data Overview

The analysis is based on a transactional dataset simulating grocery retail activity across multiple store formats.  
Each row represents the sale of a product at a specific outlet, along with related attributes describing the item, the store, and the sales result.

### Key Features of the Dataset:

#### Product-Level Fields:
- `Item_Identifier`: Unique code for each product  
- `Item_Weight`: Weight in kilograms  
- `Item_Fat_Content`: Nutritional classification (e.g., Low Fat, Regular)  
- `Item_Visibility`: Percentage visibility in the store (shelf exposure)  
- `Item_Type`: Product category (e.g., Dairy, Fruits and Vegetables, Snacks)  
- `Item_MRP`: Maximum retail price

#### Outlet-Level Fields:
- `Outlet_Identifier`: Unique store ID  
- `Outlet_Establishment_Year`: Year the store began operations  
- `Outlet_Size`: Store size category (Small, Medium, High)  
- `Outlet_Location_Type`: Geographic classification (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3)  
- `Outlet_Type`: Format of store (e.g., Supermarket Type 1, Grocery Store)

#### Sales & Rating:
- `Item_Outlet_Sales`: Total sales of each item at that outlet  
- `Rating`: Customer rating (where available)

### Data Preparation Process:
- Standardized inconsistent entries in `Item_Fat_Content` (e.g., "low fat" vs "Low Fat")
- Handled missing values in `Item_Weight` and `Outlet_Size`
- Created new groupings for analysis: fat content segments, outlet size %, location tiers
- Removed outliers in visibility and formatted values for readability
- Prepared clean pivot tables and visualizations in Excel
